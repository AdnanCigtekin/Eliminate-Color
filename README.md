# Eliminate Color

This project is about replacing the color which was selected by the user with a color with RGBA code (0,0,0,0) which is a transparent color.

This project aims to greatly reduce the upgrade time needed for game companies which are changing their game engine with much more modern one. For example, some of the older game engines use a bright pink color which has and RGB code (255,0,255) to make transparent background for the sprites..etc. If that company wants to use a modern game engine(Let's say Untiy) that company needs to replace that bright pink color with a transparent color which has a RGBA (0,0,0,0). This job can be done with most of the image editors. However, the user needs to open up every image and replace the colors by hand. This job is really time consuming especially that project has 100+ images.(Also this process is prone to human errors like missing some points.) With this little program all of those jobs gets finished in mere seconds.
